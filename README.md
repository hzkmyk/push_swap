This is a program that sorts a list of numbers using a modified stack and a limited amount of movesets in the most efficient way possible.
## There are 11 commands that move numbers in stack a and stack b.

## Let's assume that we get 50numbers on stack a.
### Find the middle number, send the smaller half to stack b, keep going until stack a has five numbers or less.
